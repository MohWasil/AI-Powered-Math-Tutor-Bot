## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic Math using AI
- Interactive quizzes for immediate feedback
- Simple conversational interface
- Modular design with a Python backend and HTML/CSS/JS frontend

---

## 📥 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application locally.

### Step 1: Download Project Files

Ensure you have the following files in the **same directory**:

- `main.py` (Python backend)
- `index.html` (Frontend UI)
- `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies)

---

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open a terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

### Step 3: Start the Python Backend Server

Run the backend server which handles AI logic:

```bash
python main.py

```

---

You should see output indicating the Flask server is running at:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

### Step 4: Start the Frontend Web Server

In a new terminal window, navigate to the project directory and start a simple HTTP server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000

```

This serves your frontend files on port 8000. Keep this terminal open as well.

---

### Step 5: Launch the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```bash
http://localhost:8000/index.html

```

You should see the Tutor Bot interface. Start asking questions about math, science, history, or other subjects in the chat box.

🎉 Enjoy learning with your AI-powered tutor!

### 📖 Additional Notes

- Make sure both backend and frontend servers are running simultaneously.

- Do not open index.html directly from the filesystem (file://...) — it won’t work properly in most browsers due to security restrictions.

- To customize or extend the project:

  - Modify main.py for backend logic.

  - Edit index.html for frontend structure or design.
